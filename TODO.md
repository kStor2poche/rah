# To do

## Choices...
- [ ] Use rust-fluent for translations as it seems much less cumbersome

## Database
- [ ] allow per-package config to be stored in the pkg db in order to remember user choices if they wish to

## Sync
### installation
- [ ] basic installation with makepkg w/ cleaning or not
- [ ] have option to build in a clean chroot

### update
- [ ] check for new commits on source of "-git" packages to know when to update and ask the user if it's the proper mechanism to use.
- [ ] option to re-build based on other packages being updated
