# Rah - Rusty AUR Helper
Some time ago, I tried to do my own [AUR helper](https://github.com/kStor2poche/yaah/) using bash just for fun, but I quickly abandoned the project because it was made in quite a convoluted way (plus I found out later that the name was already taken by another AUR helper ðŸ¥²).

So here I am, trying to make an AUR helper that
- is fast
- only handles AUR package
- has pacman-like syntax

and most importantly 
- provides interactive mechanisms when things go bad (or even if they don't) during an installation in order to fix everything, rather than trying to do its own thing and ending up breaking everything

## Structure
- main.rs &rarr; control flow
- [subcommand].rs &rarr; functions related to each of these subcommands that will be launched from main
- database.rs &rarr; helper functions for managing the package database
- config.rs &rarr; everything that manages the rah config
